## keras 2.0.9 (development)

Install the development version with: `install_github("rstudio/keras")`

- Added `multi_gpu_model()` function.

- Automatically call `keras_array()` on the results of generator functions.

- Ensure that `steps_per_epoch` is passed as an integer

- Import `evaluate()` generic from tensorflow package

- Handle `NULL` when converting R arrays to Keras friendly arrays

- Added `dataset_imbd_word_index()` function

- Ensure that `sample_weight` is passed to `fit()` as an array.

- Accept single function as `metrics` argument to `compile()`

- Automatically cast `input_shape` argument to applications to integer

- Allow Keras models to be composable within model pipelines

- Added `freeze_weights()` and `unfreeze_weights()` functions.

- Implement `export_savedmodel()` generic from TensorFlow package

- Convert R arrays to row-major before image preprocessing

- Use `tensorflow.keras` for tensorflow implementation (TF v1.4)

- Added `application_inception_resnet_v2()` pre-trained model

- Added `dataset_fashion_mnist()` dataset

- Added `layer_cudnn_gru()` and `layer_cudnn_lstm()` (faster 
  recurrent layers backed by [CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn))
  
- Added `layer_minimum()` function

- Added `interpolation` parameter to `image_load()` function

- Add `save_text_tokenizer()` and `load_text_tokenizer()` functions.

- Fix for progress bar output in Keras >= 2.0.9

- Remove deprecated `implementation` argument from recurrent layers

- Support for passing generators for validation data in `fit_generator()`

- Accept single integer arguments for kernel sizes

- Add standard layer arguments to `layer_flatten()` and `layer_separable_conv_2d()`

- Added `image_array_resize()` and `image_array_save()` for 3D image arrays.

- Allow custom layers and lambda layers to accept list parameters.

- Expose `add_loss()` function for custom layers


## keras 2.0.8 (CRAN)

- Add `use_session_with_seed()` function that establishes a random seed for the Keras session.
  Note that this should not be used when training time is paramount, as it disables GPU
  computation and CPU parallelism by default for more deterministic computations.

- Fix for plotting training history with early stopping callback (thanks to @JamesAllingham).

- Return R training history object from `fit_generator()`

- Rename `to_numpy_array()` function to `keras_array()` reflecting automatic use
  of Keras default backend float type and "C" ordering.
  
- Add standard layer arguments (e.g. `name`, `trainable`, etc.) to merge layers

- Better support for training models from data tensors in TensorFlow (e.g. Datasets, TFRecords). Add a related example script.

- Add `clone_model()` function, enabling to construct a new model, given an existing model to use as a template. Works even in a TensorFlow graph different from that of the original model.

- Add `target_tensors` argument in `compile()`, enabling to use custom tensors or placeholders as model targets.

- Add `steps_per_epoch` argument in `fit()`, enabling to train a model from data tensors in a way that is consistent with training from arrays. Similarly, add `steps` argument in `predict()` and `evaluate()`.

- Add `layer_subtract()` layer function.

- Add `weighted_metrics` argument in compile to specify metric functions meant to take into account `sample_weight` or `class_weight`.

- Enable stateful RNNs with CNTK.


## keras 2.0.6

- `install_keras()` function which installs both TensorFlow and Keras

- Use keras package as default implementation rather than tf.contrib.keras

- Training metrics plotted in realtime within the RStudio Viewer during fit 

- `serialize_model()` and `unserialize_model()` functions for saving 
  Keras models as 'raw' R objects.

- Automatically convert 64-bit R floats to backend default float type

- Ensure that arrays passed to generator functions are normalized to C-order 

- `to_numpy_array()` utility function for custom generators (enables
  custom generators to yield C-ordered arrays of the correct float type)
  
- Added `batch_size` and `write_grads` arguments to `callback_tensorboard()`

- Added `return_state` argument to recurrent layers.

- Don't re-export `install_tensorflow()` and `tf_config()` from tensorflow
  package.

- `is_keras_available()` function to probe whether the Keras python 
  package is available in the current environment.
  
- `as.data.frame()` S3 method for Keras training history

- Remove names from `keras_model()` inputs

- Return result of `evaluate()` as named list

- Write run metrics and evaluation data to tfruns

- Provide hint to use r-tensorflow environment when importing keras


## keras 2.0.5

- Initial CRAN release
