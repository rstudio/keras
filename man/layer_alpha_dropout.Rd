\title{Applies Alpha Dropout to the input.}
\usage{
layer_alpha_dropout(object, rate, noise_shape = NULL,
  seed = sample.int(10^5, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Model or layer object}

\item{rate}{float, drop probability (as with \code{layer_dropout()}). The
multiplicative noise will have standard deviation \code{sqrt(rate / (1 - rate))}.}

\item{noise_shape}{Noise shape}

\item{seed}{An integer to use as random seed.}
}
\description{
Alpha Dropout is a dropout that keeps mean and variance of inputs to their
original values, in order to ensure the self-normalizing property even after
this dropout.
}
\details{
Alpha Dropout fits well to Scaled Exponential Linear Units by randomly
setting activations to the negative saturation value.

\section{Input shape}{
 Arbitrary. Use the keyword argument \code{input_shape} (list
of integers, does not include the samples axis) when using this layer as
the first layer in a model.
}

\section{Output shape}{
 Same shape as input.
